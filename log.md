# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Finished research on 100 days of code, and tried to research what are the best ways to keep active and organized, and searched for projects to build.

**Thoughts:** I really need to get better in Javascript, so I will focus on Javascript mainly for now.
**Todo:** set up github repository for 100 days of code, and prepare for challenge!

### Day 1: June 5, 2017
##### Javascript drum kit

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Javascript 'project' which is main goal to have an functional web-application. I have set up Gulp to automate small tasks( browser refreshing, and CSS injecting and stuff), and decided to structure working directory to be optimized and modular as possible. 
  Finished task in about 3 hours, I'm still strugling for now with some Js and Gulp functionality but I think it will be better and better in future. In the end I'm kinda satisfied with the project, nothing special but its something at least :) .

**Thoughts:** Will focus more on Gulp automating, because its really time saver and I see a lot of opportunies in it, also Js, Js and Js!

### Day 2: June 6, 2017
##### Basic Algorhitms on FCC

**Today's Progress**: Finished Last few algorhitms from Basic Algorhitm scripting section on FCC. Going to start jQuerry tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I can't tell that this algorhitms were easy, they required a lot of thinking and MDN and Stackoverflow referencing, but I really enjoed solving few of them. The hardest one was definetly Seek and Destroy, and I think that I spent almost 5-6 hours trying to solve it, thanks to fact that I didnt realised that numbers in func. parameters beside array were arguments and not another array... Same thing with bloody Caesars cipher, nowhere in description is mentioned that letters from A to M should shift 13 forward, and from N to Z 13 backwards... Another algorhitm on which I spent almost 4 hours solving, and almost solved it somehow with all letters -13. After I found out that I should increment and not only decrement I solved it in less than 5 minutes...
So, thoughts for today: CONCENTRATE AND FOCUS MORE, DO YOUR RESEARCH AS YOU SHOULD DO!

### Day 3: June 7, 2017
##### Javascript and CSS clock

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a bit with CSS transform and transitions, was trying out new ES6 Javascript grammar and finally made an functional clock. I also worked on an side project, web page about imaginary travel agency, also implementing new CSS and Js stuff I learned.

**Thoughts:** There is so much stuff in CSS I didn't even heard about, also I like new Ecma Script but will probably need some time to get relaxed with some things that are implemented in it. I will try to use more ES6 code from now on, and to learn to use Babel, I'll need it for sure because ES5 is still a standard Js for most of applications.

### Day 4: June 8, 2017
##### MongoDB M101JS and CS50 Course - Week two

**Today's Progress**: Finished week two lectures and assignments for M101JS course, and finished main Cs50 lecture. 

**Thoughts:** While front-end development IS important, back-end also deserves a lot of attention, and as a future full stack developer I have plans to focus on both worlds. I already started learning about back-end in may, even made a complex website wit its own backend infrastructure, and I will continue learning about databases for now, MongoDB seems nice and simple enough for now. Also practiced a little bit with C today, while watching Cs50 lecture, and tomorrow I'm going to solve C crypto assignments.

### Day 5: June 9, 2017
##### Simple gallery

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd Cs50 problem set, and updated an project from last month with some new stuff

**Thoughts:** Definitely need more practice with algorhitms and javascript. Spent almost 6 hours trying to solve Caesars and Vignere ciphers( in C, but oh well).

### Day 6: June 10, 2017
##### Practice with CSS3 variables

**Today's Progress**: Didnt even knew that CSS have its own variables! Interesting stuff. I will try to implement it more in future projects. 

**Thoughts:** CSS and HTML are more complex than I thought, there is a lot of stuff I've never heard of damn, I should work on that too :/

### Day 7: June 11, 2017
##### Flexbox gallery

**Today's Progress**: Made this one-page gallery featuring flexbox and cheesy motivational quotes :)

**Thoughts:** Interesting way to make a gallery app, but not very practical. Maybe it can serve as webpage somehow, hmmm.
Gonna start making some dummy websites, to practice and to explore some new ideas.

**Today's Progress**: Studied You dont know Js the 3rd book today, and made an search engine mimic application( It's just filtering through array :P ). 

**Thoughts:** Thinking about making search engine for Pokedex x)
