# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Finished research on 100 days of code, and tried to research what are the best ways to keep active and organized, and searched for projects to build.

**Thoughts:** I really need to get better in Javascript, so I will focus on Javascript mainly for now.
**Todo:** set up github repository for 100 days of code, and prepare for challenge!

### Day 1: June 5, 2017
##### Javascript drum kit

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Javascript 'project' which is main goal to have an functional web-application. I have set up Gulp to automate small tasks( browser refreshing, and CSS injecting and stuff), and decided to structure working directory to be optimized and modular as possible. 
  Finished task in about 3 hours, I'm still strugling for now with some Js and Gulp functionality but I think it will be better and better in future. In the end I'm kinda satisfied with the project, nothing special but its something at least :) .

**Thoughts:** Will focus more on Gulp automating, because its really time saver and I see a lot of opportunies in it, also Js, Js and Js!
