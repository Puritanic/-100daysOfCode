# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Finished research on 100 days of code, and tried to research what are the best ways to stay active and organized, and searched for projects to build.

**Thoughts:** I really need to get better in Javascript, so I will focus on Javascript mainly for now.
**Todo:** set up github repository for 100 days of code, and prepare for challenge!

### Day 1: June 5, 2017
##### Javascript drum kit

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Javascript 'project' which is main goal to have an functional web-application. I have set up Gulp to automate small tasks( browser refreshing, and CSS injecting and stuff), and decided to structure working directory to be optimized and modular as possible. 
  Finished task in about 3 hours, I'm still strugling for now with some Js and Gulp functionality but I think it will be better and better in future. In the end I'm kinda satisfied with the project, nothing special but its something at least :) .

**Thoughts:** Will focus more on Gulp automating, because its really time saver and I see a lot of opportunies in it, also Js, Js and Js!

### Day 2: June 6, 2017
##### Basic Algorhitms on FCC

**Today's Progress**: Finished Last few algorhitms from Basic Algorhitm scripting section on FCC. Going to start jQuerry tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I can't tell that this algorhitms were easy, they required a lot of thinking and MDN and Stackoverflow referencing, but I really enjoed solving few of them. The hardest one was definetly Seek and Destroy, and I think that I spent almost 5-6 hours trying to solve it, thanks to fact that I didnt realised that numbers in func. parameters beside array were arguments and not another array... Same thing with bloody Caesars cipher, nowhere in description is mentioned that letters from A to M should shift 13 forward, and from N to Z 13 backwards... Another algorhitm on which I spent almost 4 hours solving, and almost solved it somehow with all letters -13. After I found out that I should increment and not only decrement I solved it in less than 5 minutes...
So, thoughts for today: CONCENTRATE AND FOCUS MORE, DO YOUR RESEARCH AS YOU SHOULD DO!

### Day 3: June 7, 2017
##### Javascript and CSS clock

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a bit with CSS transform and transitions, was trying out new ES6 Javascript grammar and finally made an functional clock. I also worked on an side project, web page about imaginary travel agency, also implementing new CSS and Js stuff I learned.

**Thoughts:** There is so much stuff in CSS I didn't even heard about, also I like new Ecma Script but will probably need some time to get relaxed with some things that are implemented in it. I will try to use more ES6 code from now on, and to learn to use Babel, I'll need it for sure because ES5 is still a standard Js for most of applications.

### Day 4: June 8, 2017
##### MongoDB M101JS and CS50 Course - Week two

**Today's Progress**: Finished week two lectures and assignments for M101JS course, and finished main Cs50 lecture. 

**Thoughts:** While front-end development IS important, back-end also deserves a lot of attention, and as a future full stack developer I have plans to focus on both worlds. I already started learning about back-end in may, even made a complex website wit its own backend infrastructure, and I will continue learning about databases for now, MongoDB seems nice and simple enough for now. Also practiced a little bit with C today, while watching Cs50 lecture, and tomorrow I'm going to solve C crypto assignments.

### Day 5: June 9, 2017
##### Simple gallery

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd Cs50 problem set, and updated an project from last month with some new stuff

**Thoughts:** Definitely need more practice with algorhitms and javascript. Spent almost 6 hours trying to solve Caesars and Vignere ciphers( in C, but oh well).

### Day 6: June 10, 2017
##### Practice with CSS3 variables

**Today's Progress**: Didnt even knew that CSS have its own variables! Interesting stuff. I will try to implement it more in future projects. 

**Thoughts:** CSS and HTML are more complex than I thought, there is a lot of stuff I've never heard of damn, I should work on that too :/

### Day 7: June 11, 2017
##### Flexbox gallery

**Today's Progress**: Made this one-page gallery featuring flexbox and cheesy motivational quotes :)

**Thoughts:** Interesting way to make a gallery app, but not very practical. Maybe it can serve as webpage somehow, hmmm.
Gonna start making some dummy websites, to practice and to explore some new ideas.

### Day 8: June 12, 2017
##### Search-form

**Today's Progress**: Studied You dont know Js the 3rd book today, and made an search engine mimic application( It's just filtering through array :P ). 

**Thoughts:** Thinking about making search engine for Pokedex x)

### Day 9: June 13, 2017
##### Website template

**Today's Progress**: Finished template I was working on last two weeks. Very satisfied with the result, and my first project using BEM approach and modular file structure for css and js files, and webpack. Also implemented support for legacy brwosers just in case. Going to continue Advanced Javascript courese by Kyle Simpson later.

**Thoughts:** Automating stuff with gulp and using webpack in projects is really useful. I'm going to make an template for projects with gulp and webpack asap.

### Day 10: June 14, 2017
##### HTML5 Canvas

**Today's Progress**: I've heard about HTML canvas few months ago, but didnt had time to take a look at it, so I decided to give it a go today, and, man, its fun :D Interesting thing, and I will practice more with it for sure!

**Thoughts:** No thoughts , tired as fu*k going to sleep...

### Day 11: June 15, 2017
##### Checkboxes, and Mongo

**Today's Progress**: Watched through all lectures of week three MongoDB University, and will leave homework for tomorrow. Also did a small stupid practice with Js where I setup checking multiple boxes while holding Shift key.

**Thoughts:** Going to focus on ES6 syntax, and to start using it in my code where I can. Also MongoDb looks like an interesting database, I especially like its database system, with JSON datafiles.

### Day 12: June 17, 2017
##### YDKJs and MongoDB homework

**Today's Progress**: Finished homework for MongoDB Week 3. I got really confused with regex part of homework, it was nothing hard, I just forgot $regex lessons. Once I realised what I need to do and how to setup I solved it in under 5 minutes, next one too. Also finished this and Obj. prototypes by Kyle Simpson, prototypes are still confusing me, I kinda get the point, but I still have feeling that I;m missing something... Going to start CS50 week 3 tomorrow if there is enough time. 

### Day 13: June 18, 2017
##### FCC Quote app generator 

**Today's Progress**: Finally started working on random quote generator from FCC challenges section. I guess the hardest part was finding an actually free and good API to use, after that i finished writing code in under an hour. It works good, now I just need to style it.

**Thoughts:** I feel the progress !

### Day 14: June 19, 2017
##### FCC Quote app and splash-page template

**Today's Progress**: Styled a bit quote app, and then stranded away from it when I encountered Precss package here on GitHub. Was reading a bit about it, and then installed it alongside with gulp and few other packages and started working on splashpage. Really great tool!

**Thoughts:** I kinda fear that I dont get used to libraries and frameworks, and dont learn vanilla Js/Css and how to use it in specific situations. Precss is great tool, but I will also look to alternatives to it where I can, just to see how something can be done with simple CSS, also I'm trying to evade using jQuery when I can, I've heard that using it can be really bad for Js knowledge, heh.

### Day 15: June 20, 2017
##### Cloned webpage and practiced with Js

**Today's Progress**: Finished wepbage I started working on yesterday, explored some options in Postcss while working on it, and its an really complex tool for CSS operations. Also practiced with Async java, and read through Gulp docs, but it's still kind off too complex for me... Will leave it for later.

**Thoughts:** I feel asleep while working on Gulp code.

### Day 16: June 21, 2017
##### Gulp Template

**Today's Progress**: Made a reusable Gulp template for projects automated by it. Also included a bunch of other usefull stuff, like Postcss/Precss, Webpack, Babel and others. I will troubleshoot it for possible bugs in next few days, but I think thats it. Now my coding start will be much faster and easier ^^. Also watched a few lectures on ES6 generators and promises.

**Thoughts:** 2 hours of work on template today, and about 20-30 min less for project setups in the future. Time is precioussss.

### Day 17: June 21, 2017
##### HTML5 Video player

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a bit with HTML5 video elements, wrote some Js, and everything worked well until I started working on fullscreen video. Cant figure out for life, it seems, for what event to listen when fullscreen goes on, so I didnt finished fullscreen icon change and few other small things because of that... Going to figure it out when I have more time!

**Thoughts:** Cant wait to change my current job, so that I have more time to code.

### Day 18: June 22, 2017
##### FCC Qoute app

**Today's Progress**: Didn't had a much time for coding today, spent around hour watching Kyle Simpson's Advanced Javascript course on Pluralsight, and then worked a while on my Quote app, added a few CSS animations, and learned how they work while on it.

### Day 19: June 23, 2017
##### Quote app, again

**Today's Progress**: Finished(in a hacky and crappy way) Twitter share button implementation into quote app.

**Thoughts:** For what I thought that is going to be like an hour of work at the worst, ate almost half of my day... I didn't had idead that Twitter share implementation, with quote in share message will be this hard to setup... Tired and angry.

### Day 20: June 23, 2017
##### A bunch of stuff

**Today's Progress**: Finished MongoDB week 4, along with its homework, finished desktop version for my Quote app, implemented twitter share function (somehow), now I need to setup viewing for mobile devices, and resolve a possible problem with API http origin... Made small javascript function for activating html classes on page scroll, used something like that already in my webpage-template project with waypoints npm package. 

**Thoughts:** Did a lot today, I feel like some things are pointlesly complicated, like that twitter share button, it shoul be more accesible and customizable -.-
