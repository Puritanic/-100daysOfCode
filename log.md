# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Finished research on 100 days of code, and tried to research what are the best ways to stay active and organized, and searched for projects to build.

**Thoughts:** I really need to get better in Javascript, so I will focus on Javascript mainly for now.
**Todo:** set up github repository for 100 days of code, and prepare for challenge!

### Day 1: June 5, 2017
##### Javascript drum kit

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Javascript 'project' which is main goal to have an functional web-application. I have set up Gulp to automate small tasks( browser refreshing, and CSS injecting and stuff), and decided to structure working directory to be optimized and modular as possible. 
  Finished task in about 3 hours, I'm still strugling for now with some Js and Gulp functionality but I think it will be better and better in future. In the end I'm kinda satisfied with the project, nothing special but its something at least :) .

**Thoughts:** Will focus more on Gulp automating, because its really time saver and I see a lot of opportunies in it, also Js, Js and Js!

### Day 2: June 6, 2017
##### Basic Algorhitms on FCC

**Today's Progress**: Finished Last few algorhitms from Basic Algorhitm scripting section on FCC. Going to start jQuerry tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I can't tell that this algorhitms were easy, they required a lot of thinking and MDN and Stackoverflow referencing, but I really enjoed solving few of them. The hardest one was definetly Seek and Destroy, and I think that I spent almost 5-6 hours trying to solve it, thanks to fact that I didnt realised that numbers in func. parameters beside array were arguments and not another array... Same thing with bloody Caesars cipher, nowhere in description is mentioned that letters from A to M should shift 13 forward, and from N to Z 13 backwards... Another algorhitm on which I spent almost 4 hours solving, and almost solved it somehow with all letters -13. After I found out that I should increment and not only decrement I solved it in less than 5 minutes...
So, thoughts for today: CONCENTRATE AND FOCUS MORE, DO YOUR RESEARCH AS YOU SHOULD DO!

### Day 3: June 7, 2017
##### Javascript and CSS clock

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a bit with CSS transform and transitions, was trying out new ES6 Javascript grammar and finally made an functional clock. I also worked on an side project, web page about imaginary travel agency, also implementing new CSS and Js stuff I learned.

**Thoughts:** There is so much stuff in CSS I didn't even heard about, also I like new Ecma Script but will probably need some time to get relaxed with some things that are implemented in it. I will try to use more ES6 code from now on, and to learn to use Babel, I'll need it for sure because ES5 is still a standard Js for most of applications.

### Day 4: June 8, 2017
##### MongoDB M101JS and CS50 Course - Week two

**Today's Progress**: Finished week two lectures and assignments for M101JS course, and finished main Cs50 lecture. 

**Thoughts:** While front-end development IS important, back-end also deserves a lot of attention, and as a future full stack developer I have plans to focus on both worlds. I already started learning about back-end in may, even made a complex website wit its own backend infrastructure, and I will continue learning about databases for now, MongoDB seems nice and simple enough for now. Also practiced a little bit with C today, while watching Cs50 lecture, and tomorrow I'm going to solve C crypto assignments.

### Day 5: June 9, 2017
##### Simple gallery

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd Cs50 problem set, and updated an project from last month with some new stuff

**Thoughts:** Definitely need more practice with algorhitms and javascript. Spent almost 6 hours trying to solve Caesars and Vignere ciphers( in C, but oh well).

### Day 6: June 10, 2017
##### Practice with CSS3 variables

**Today's Progress**: Didnt even knew that CSS have its own variables! Interesting stuff. I will try to implement it more in future projects. 

**Thoughts:** CSS and HTML are more complex than I thought, there is a lot of stuff I've never heard of damn, I should work on that too :/

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/100daysOfCode/tree/master/Day%206%20-%20Practice%20with%20Css%20vars

### Day 7: June 11, 2017
##### Flexbox gallery

**Today's Progress**: Made this one-page gallery featuring flexbox and cheesy motivational quotes :)

**Thoughts:** Interesting way to make a gallery app, but not very practical. Maybe it can serve as webpage somehow, hmmm.
Gonna start making some dummy websites, to practice and to explore some new ideas.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/100daysOfCode/tree/master/Day%207%20-%20Gallery

### Day 8: June 12, 2017
##### Search-form

**Today's Progress**: Studied You dont know Js the 3rd book today, and made an search engine mimic application( It's just filtering through array :P ). 

**Thoughts:** Thinking about making search engine for Pokedex x)

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/100daysOfCode/tree/master/Day%208%20-%20Search%20'engine'

### Day 9: June 13, 2017
##### Website template

**Today's Progress**: Finished template I was working on last two weeks. Very satisfied with the result, and my first project using BEM approach and modular file structure for css and js files, and webpack. Also implemented support for legacy brwosers just in case. Going to continue Advanced Javascript courese by Kyle Simpson later.

**Thoughts:** Automating stuff with gulp and using webpack in projects is really useful. I'm going to make an template for projects with gulp and webpack asap.

### Day 10: June 14, 2017
##### HTML5 Canvas

**Today's Progress**: I've heard about HTML canvas few months ago, but didnt had time to take a look at it, so I decided to give it a go today, and, man, its fun :D Interesting thing, and I will practice more with it for sure!

**Thoughts:** No thoughts , tired as fu*k going to sleep...

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/100daysOfCode/tree/master/Day%2010%20-%20Canvas

### Day 11: June 15, 2017
##### Checkboxes, and Mongo

**Today's Progress**: Watched through all lectures of week three MongoDB University, and will leave homework for tomorrow. Also did a small stupid practice with Js where I setup checking multiple boxes while holding Shift key.

**Thoughts:** Going to focus on ES6 syntax, and to start using it in my code where I can. Also MongoDb looks like an interesting database, I especially like its database system, with JSON datafiles.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/100daysOfCode/tree/master/Day%2011%20-%20Checkboxes

### Day 12: June 17, 2017
##### YDKJs and MongoDB homework

**Today's Progress**: Finished homework for MongoDB Week 3. I got really confused with regex part of homework, it was nothing hard, I just forgot $regex lessons. Once I realised what I need to do and how to setup I solved it in under 5 minutes, next one too. Also finished this and Obj. prototypes by Kyle Simpson, prototypes are still confusing me, I kinda get the point, but I still have feeling that I;m missing something... Going to start CS50 week 3 tomorrow if there is enough time. 

### Day 13: June 18, 2017
##### FCC Quote app generator 

**Today's Progress**: Finally started working on random quote generator from FCC challenges section. I guess the hardest part was finding an actually free and good API to use, after that i finished writing code in under an hour. It works good, now I just need to style it.

**Thoughts:** I feel the progress ! 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/Quote_machine


### Day 14: June 19, 2017
##### FCC Quote app and splash-page template

**Today's Progress**: Styled a bit quote app, and then stranded away from it when I encountered Precss package here on GitHub. Was reading a bit about it, and then installed it alongside with gulp and few other packages and started working on splashpage. Really great tool!

**Thoughts:** I kinda fear that I dont get used to libraries and frameworks, and dont learn vanilla Js/Css and how to use it in specific situations. Precss is great tool, but I will also look to alternatives to it where I can, just to see how something can be done with simple CSS, also I'm trying to evade using jQuery when I can, I've heard that using it can be really bad for Js knowledge, heh.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/Quote_machine

### Day 15: June 20, 2017
##### Cloned webpage and practiced with Js

**Today's Progress**: Finished wepbage I started working on yesterday, explored some options in Postcss while working on it, and its an really complex tool for CSS operations. Also practiced with Async java, and read through Gulp docs, but it's still kind off too complex for me... Will leave it for later.

**Thoughts:** I feel asleep while working on Gulp code.

**Link to work:** https://puritanic.github.io/site-template/  

### Day 16: June 21, 2017
##### Gulp Template

**Today's Progress**: Made a reusable Gulp template for projects automated by it. Also included a bunch of other usefull stuff, like Postcss/Precss, Webpack, Babel and others. I will troubleshoot it for possible bugs in next few days, but I think thats it. Now my coding start will be much faster and easier ^^. Also watched a few lectures on ES6 generators and promises.

**Thoughts:** 2 hours of work on template today, and about 20-30 min less for project setups in the future. Time is precioussss.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/gulp-project_template

### Day 17: June 21, 2017
##### HTML5 Video player

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a bit with HTML5 video elements, wrote some Js, and everything worked well until I started working on fullscreen video. Cant figure out for life, it seems, for what event to listen when fullscreen goes on, so I didnt finished fullscreen icon change and few other small things because of that... Going to figure it out when I have more time!

**Thoughts:** Cant wait to change my current job, so that I have more time to code.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/100daysOfCode/tree/master/Day%2017%20-%20Video_player

### Day 18-19: June 23, 2017
##### FCC Qoute app

**Today's Progress**: Didn't had a much time for coding today, spent around hour watching Kyle Simpson's Advanced Javascript course on Pluralsight, and then worked a while on my Quote app, added a few CSS animations, and learned how they work while on it.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/Quote_machine

### Day 20: June 24, 2017
##### Quote app, again

**Today's Progress**: Finished(in a hacky and crappy way) Twitter share button implementation into quote app.

**Thoughts:** For what I thought that is going to be like an hour of work at the worst, ate almost half of my day... I didn't had idead that Twitter share implementation, with quote in share message will be this hard to setup... Tired and angry.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/Quote_machine

### Day 20: June 25, 2017
##### A bunch of stuff

**Today's Progress**: Finished MongoDB week 4, along with its homework, finished desktop version for my Quote app, implemented twitter share function (somehow), now I need to setup viewing for mobile devices, and resolve a possible problem with API http origin... Made small javascript function for activating html classes on page scroll, used something like that already in my webpage-template project with waypoints npm package. 

**Thoughts:** Did a lot today, I feel like some things are pointlesly complicated, like that twitter share button, it shoul be more accesible and customizable -.- 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/100daysOfCode

### Day 21: June 26, 2017
##### Quote app deployed

**Today's Progress**: Random quote generator for FCC front-end dev challenges done! So... I finished everything( js, css, html) and deployed app to GitHub just to be greeted with 'connection refused' message, because API that I used for quotes serves from HTTP and GitHub doesnt accept non-secure connection. I just wanted to throm PC through the window when I thought that I will need to find another API and start over implementing it into project... Luckily I kept calm, and tried to deploy app on Surge, and VOILA! It worked :)) Thanks Surge! 

**Thoughts:** Definitely will lookup all details about API-s I'll use in future. Not paying attention can cost so much time and nerves.

### Day 22: June 27, 2017
##### Cs50 week 3

**Today's Progress**: Watched through Cs50 week 3 lectures and shorts, and tried to solve psets... After that solved two tasks at HackerRank, in 4 different languages ^^

**Thoughts:** I can say that before that I  actually felt like I have solid knowledge of coding, but after looking at psets, and trying to solve them on my own, I realised that I don't know shit, sadly... I solved them in about 8 hours, Google helped, beer helped, and fact that I solved few HackerRank tasks easily cheered me up a little.

### Day 23: June 28, 2017
##### Responsive site 

**Today's Progress**: I needed a break after all that algorhitms yesterday, so I spent almost half day working on a responsive site project. Also worked a little on build-to-learn project for Chingu, its going well, but my pair-programming buddy seems gone. I guess that I will finish splashpage on my own.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/Responsive_site

### Day 24: June 29, 2017
##### YelpCamp clone

**Today's Progress**: Spent good part of my day working on improvements for my YelpCamp website. I've implemented User profiles, and pages, added pagination and searching through campgrounds. Also started to style it, and will work more on it in next few days when I have time.

**Thoughts:** I need to start working on some opensource applications on GitHub... Too bad I dont have idea where to start, and what should I look, heh.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/YelpCamp_clone

### Day 25: June 30, 2017
##### YelpCamp clone

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 5 of MongoDB Academy, and pushed to GitHub my boilerplate for gulp/postcss projects. Will be doing more improvements on it in the future. Also sorted my notes, I mean, tried to sort them, but they are damn mess, and I will try to clean them a bit tommorow on work.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/gulp-html5-postcss-boilerplate


### Day 26: July 1, 2017
##### Objects and prototypes

**Today's Progress**: Spent my coding time for today reading about objects and prototypes(again). Too much work piled up on my actual job, I guess tomorrow there will be no time for coding... :(



### Day 27: July 2, 2017
##### Notes 

**Today's Progress**: I found a little time to sort my notes on programming, and to upload them to Github, just in case. They are in such mess, I dont even knew I had so much stuff writen... going to sort them in small batches, whenever I can.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/verbose-octo-sniffle


### Day 28: July 3, 2017
##### Notes 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning patterns and how to use them via Javascript Patters course on Pluralsight. Loks okay for now, but there are few thing where I disagree with instructor( under heavy influence of Kyle Simpson).

### Day 28: July 4, 2017
#### Javascript design patterns

**Today's Progress**: Fnished the first two sections of the course on fast forward, I already know most of this things as this things and how they work  are mentioned in YDKJS. Anyway, gonna rewatch 2nd section again and take some notes alongside.

### Day 29: July 5, 2017
##### Angular and Node.js

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Angular and Node.js, still looking for resources for my Weather app.

**Thoughts:** As I can see Node.js will be top of the creme in next few years, so I'm definetly going to focus on it. Still in doubt should I choose Angular or React, I'll look into Angular for now and will see what works better for me.


### Day 30: July 6, 2017
##### Angular and Node.js

**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday, reading about Angular mostly for now, seems interesting. also worked a bit on splashpage project for Chingu.

**Thoughts:** build-to-learn project is nearly done, and I'm already looking for something interesting to work on after. The main letdown for learning React is that I need to learn XML too, dont really know is it hard, but its annoying.

### Day 31: July 8, 2017
##### Angular and Node.js

**Today's Progress**: Finished build-to-learn project for Chingu! The only thing that i didnt acomplished is taht little Callie svg in title of the site, couldn't for a life make it to move as it should on small screens, but everything else is good, also added some hr elements and restructured mobile view of the purple section of the site. Weather app next project.

**Thoughts:** Took a rest from coding yesterday, and played XCOM x) I guess strategy games like that help in brain exercising. Also realized that Lost grid is really cool thing, and will probably use it in all my future projects where I need any grid.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/Splash-page_clone

### Day 32: July 9, 2017
##### Javascript Design Patterns

**Today's Progress**:  Rewatched the 2nd section of the course and was taking notes alongside. Learned about Module ,Singleton, Factory, Facade, Flyweight and few other patterns, when to and for what should I use them.

**Thoughts:** The instructor of the course is actively using new ES6 class syntax while working with patterns, I'm going to restructure my code in notes into *_OLOO_* design by Kyle when I have more time, because I really like its simple solution for code.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/verbose-octo-sniffle/tree/master/Javascript/JavaScript-Notes/designpattern


### Day 33: July 10, 2017
##### Vscode

**Today's Progress**: Decided to try out Visual Code Studio editor on suggestion from cohort mate, and I'll be damned if it isn't great! Installed Vscode, customized it with plugins and took it for a ride, going to change my preffered editor from Sublime to Vscode I guess.

**Thoughts:**  I'm really suprised that Microsoft made something like this. I works fast, have really great plugins, I just miss one or two from Sublime(Hayaku!!!) but all others seems to have their own counterparts for Vscode. 


### Day 34: July 11, 2017
##### MongoDB Week 6

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 6, played a little with the crunchbase db. Solved a few problems on Euler and one algorithm on HackerRank.

**Thoughts:** Everyday practicing with algorithms will be on my must-to-do list from now on.

### Day 35: July 12, 2017
##### Udemy Javascript Weird Parts

**Today's Progress**: Finished 6th and 7th section of the course, played a bit with object creating and mutating properties.

**Thoughts:** ITs so hot here, I cant focus enough... 43 degrees right now, im going to boil x( 
Finished polishing code from a few practices i did last few days, Cs50 is still waiting for me, and I guess that Im too  overextended with all resources. Going to focus on important things for the next week or two, and will continue everything else.

### Day 36: July 13, 2017
##### Javascript Weird Parts - framework

**Today's Progress**: Set up framework from lectures, and added a few new features(languages).

**Thoughts:** Frameworks are not that scary once you realize how they work, and how they are bult. Going to dwelwe through jQuery, Underscore.js and Lodash once I have more time, for sure.

### Day 37: July 14, 2017
##### Cs50 Week4 

**Today's Progress**: Watched lecture and shorts for Cs50 week 4. Played a bit with C.

**Thoughts:** Psets are looking terryfying :( Gonna try tommorow to solve them(at least one).

### Day 38: July 15, 2017
##### Cs50 Week4 psets

**Today's Progress**: Solved the first problem for Cs50 week 4. Watched the first half of lectures M101JS.

**Thoughts:** Solution to the first problem was so easy, litteraly 3-4 lines of code, but I spent around 3 hours solving it...
Was so angry at me after realizing what I needed to do to solve it. I guess I'm not thinking right to solve problems still.
**Link to work:** academic honesty bla bla

### Day 39: July 16, 2017
##### Cs50 Week4 psets

**Today's Progress**: Watched shorts again, and solved 2nd and 3rd problem from Cs50 pset.

**Thoughts:** Same thing for the 2nd and 3rd problems sets, easier to solve than I thought. Lost my nerves a little when I saw that deadline for M101Js is in two days and I didnt even started to work on final project. Will try to somehow work on my algorhitm skills, and to learn somehow to think as I should to. Also I'm to lazy to post this logs to Twitter every day... I guess thats just my aversion to social networks. I should work on that too -.-

**Link to work:** academic honesty bla bla

### Day 40: July 17, 2017
##### M101Js week 7 and final project

**Today's Progress**: Watched the rest of M101js lectures and started working on final project. Enrolled to M100 MongoDb Academy course, to strenghten my knowledge, just in case. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm going to forget all of this in a week or two... Enrollet to another course abbout MongoFb, to keep my knowledge intact, or to (even better) learn more. Finished first 3 labs on final project, and they are not that easy like I've heard... I dont know will I make it in time, because half of my code doesnt work like it should...

**Link to work:** going to upload after I finish it...

### Day 41: July 18, 2017
##### M101Js final project

**Today's Progress**: Watched the rest of M101js lectures and started working on final project. Enrolled to M100 MongoDb Academy course, to strenghten my knowledge, just in case. 
edit: Finished it!

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm going to forget all of this in a week or two... Enrollet to another course abbout MongoFb, to keep my knowledge intact, or to (even better) learn more. Finished first 3 labs on final project, and they are not that easy like I've heard... I dont know will I make it in time, because half of my code doesnt work like it should...

### Day 42: July 19, 2017
##### M101Js final project

**Today's Progress**: Finished M101js final project, and started again going through Shay Howe's HTML and CSS book.

**Thoughts:** Getting back on track with P1xt guide and FCC, I strained too much from the path... So, no to Ruby, Node.js, and Angular.js for now. First things first.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/verbose-octo-sniffle/tree/master/HTML%26CSS


### Day 43: July 20, 2017
##### Shay Howe's Advanced HTML and CSS

**Today's Progress**: Finished Shay Howe's HTML and CSS, both Basci and Advanced. Bookmarked few things to read later, mostly about css animations and transitions. Worked a bit on my code for weather app.

**Thoughts:** Accepted to Chingy Voyage ^^ . Next week or two will focus on projects there, along with Cs50 and M100 course.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Puritanic/verbose-octo-sniffle/tree/master/HTML%26CSS

### Day 44: July 21, 2017
##### Cs50 Week 5

**Today's Progress**: Watched Week 5 lectures and gone through notes after lecture, just in case I missed something.

**Thoughts:** Accepted to Chingy Voyage ^^ . Next week or two will focus on projects there, along with Cs50 and M100 course.

### Day 45: July 22, 2017
##### M100 Week 1

**Today's Progress**: Watched Week 1 lectures of M100 mongodb course.

**Thoughts:** Turtles Team 17, Chingu Voyage ^^ Cant wait for project to start.
