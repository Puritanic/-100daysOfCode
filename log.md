# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Finished research on 100 days of code, and tried to research what are the best ways to keep active and organized, and searched for projects to build.

**Thoughts:** I really need to get better in Javascript, so I will focus on Javascript mainly for now.
**Todo:** set up github repository for 100 days of code, and prepare for challenge!

### Day 1: June 5, 2017
##### Javascript drum kit

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Javascript 'project' which is main goal to have an functional web-application. I have set up Gulp to automate small tasks( browser refreshing, and CSS injecting and stuff), and decided to structure working directory to be optimized and modular as possible. 
  Finished task in about 3 hours, I'm still strugling for now with some Js and Gulp functionality but I think it will be better and better in future. In the end I'm kinda satisfied with the project, nothing special but its something at least :) .

**Thoughts:** Will focus more on Gulp automating, because its really time saver and I see a lot of opportunies in it, also Js, Js and Js!

### Day 2: June 6, 2017
##### Basic Algorhitms on FCC

**Today's Progress**: Finished Last few algorhitms from Basic Algorhitm scripting section on FCC. Going to start jQuerry tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I can't tell that this algorhitms were easy, they required a lot of thinking and MDN and Stackoverflow referencing, but I really enjoed solving few of them. The hardest one was definetly Seek and Destroy, and I think that I spent almost 5-6 hours trying to solve it, thanks to fact that I didnt realised that numbers in func. parameters beside array were arguments and not another array... Same thing with bloody Caesars cipher, nowhere in description is mentioned that letters from A to M should shift 13 forward, and from N to Z 13 backwards... Another algorhitm on which I spent almost 4 hours solving, and almost solved it somehow with all letters -13. After I found out that I should increment and not only decrement I solved it in less than 5 minutes...
So, thoughts for today: CONCENTRATE AND FOCUS MORE, DO YOUR RESEARCH AS YOU SHOULD DO!

### Day 3: June 7, 2017
##### Javascript and CSS clock

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a bit with CSS transform and transitions, was trying out new ES6 Javascript grammar and finally made an functional clock. I also worked on an side project, web page about imaginary travel agency, also implementing new CSS and Js stuff I learned.

**Thoughts:** There is so much stuff in CSS I didn't even heard about, also I like new Ecma Script but will probably need some time to get relaxed with some things that are implemented in it. I will try to use more ES6 code from now on, and to learn to use Babel, I'll need it for sure because ES5 is still a standard Js for most of applications.
